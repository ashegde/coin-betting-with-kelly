# coin-betting-with-kelly

Simple example illustrating coin betting with the Kelly criterion.

I have found the following references useful and interesting:

Thorp, Edward O. "The Kelly criterion in blackjack sports betting, and the stock market." Handbook of asset and liability management. North-Holland, 2008. 385-428. (pdf: https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/Thorpe_KellyCriterion2007.pdf)

Haghani, Victor, and Richard Dewey. "Rational decision-making under uncertainty: Observed betting patterns on a biased coin." arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.01427 (2017).

Naturally, the original reference for Kelly's work is:

Kelly, John L. "A new interpretation of information rate." The Bell System Technical Journal 35.4 (1956): 917-926.
